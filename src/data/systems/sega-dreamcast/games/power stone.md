### Sinopsis
Power Stone is a 3D fighting game made by Capcom. Power Stone was initially released on the Sega NAOMI hardware and later ported to the Dreamcast. In October 2006, Capcom ported the game and its sequel Power Stone 2 to the PlayStation Portable as Power Stone Collection. An anime TV series based on the game ran in 1999 from April 3 to September 25.

### GamePlay
Gameplay involves selecting a character and then proceeding to battle the other characters, one at a time, in various locales. The three-dimensional fighting includes the ability to use special attacks as well as to pick up and fight with such objects as tables, chairs, rocks and bombs. During battle, "Power Stones", resembling gems of different colors, appear in the arena. If a character collects three Power Stones, they transform into a more powerful version of themself. The character will then be able to use one of two super special attacks: generally a massive long-range power attack and a grab or close-range move. The powered-up mode only lasts until the power bar is fully drained, during which the special attack can be executed (which completely depletes the power bar) or other, lesser special moves can be executed (which only use a small portion of power). Each match continues until the life bar of one of the two characters fighting is depleted.
