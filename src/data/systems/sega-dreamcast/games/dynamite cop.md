### Sinopsis
Dynamite Cop, known in Japan as Dynamite Deka 2 (ダイナマイト刑事2, Dainamaito Deka Tsu), is a 1998 beat 'em up video game published by Sega and initially released in arcades on Sega Model 2 hardware. It is the sequel to the 1996 game Dynamite Deka, which was released outside Japan as Die Hard Arcade. The game was ported to the Dreamcast and released internationally in 1999, this time without the Die Hard license. A second sequel, Asian Dynamite, was released only in arcades.

Its main character, Delinger, makes a cameo appearance in The House of the Dead 2 as a playable character via a special item obtainable in the original mode (present in home versions of The House of the Dead 2). Bruno Delinger also makes an appearance in Project X Zone as a solo unit character.

A chicken-leg from Golden Axe makes a cameo appearance on the Island stage.

### GamePlay
Dynamite Cop is a 3D beat 'em up for up to two players in which players play as either Bruno Delinger, Jean Ivy, or Eddie Brown and fight through levels on board a cruise ship and on a deserted island to save the President's daughter from a band of modern-day pirates led by Wolf "White Fang" Hongo, the main antagonist from the first game. The classic Sega arcade game Tranquilizer Gun (1980) is included as a bonus game on the Dreamcast version. Clearing all missions will enable you to play Tranquilizer Gun an unlimited number of times.
