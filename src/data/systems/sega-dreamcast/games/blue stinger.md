### Sinopsis
Blue Stinger (ブルー スティンガー, Burū Sutingā) is an action survival horror game released in 1999 for the Dreamcast game console, developed by Climax Graphics and originally published by Sega, with publishing rights outside of Japan obtained by Activision. The game was conceived by then-Climax CEO, Shinya Nishigaki.

Eliot Ballade is on vacation off the coast of Dinosaur Island with his friend Tim fishing on a boat. While preparing for a Christmas party on the boat, a meteorite crashes into the island and sends a large barrier out which cuts Eliot's boat in half leaving him inside of the barrier. Just then a mysterious light approaches and takes the form of Tim's good luck charm "Nephilim", shortly afterward several creatures storm toward the boat and destroy it. Eliot swims to shore. On shore, Eliot is assisted by Nephilim and meets Dogs Bower (based on 1990s Japan wrestling icon "Dr. Death" Steve Williams[4]), an original discoverer of the island and a local sea captain. The two team up as they explore the island and confront the monsters and mutations that have taken it over.

Saved by a woman named Janine King, the duo head to the control center of KIMRAs base. There, they meet Janine formally and discuss what to do. Dogs suggests heading into town to find survivors and to head to Rats Bar for more information. With no better plan, the two set off. Conquering the various monsters while exploring a shopping center, freezer, and saving several others the duo eventually arrive at Rats Bar. Meeting Rats, the owner, he gives the duo a Lab Keycard he was holding as collateral. The duo reconvene inside the control center and discuss with Janine what their next plan of action is. Janine attempts to use the keycard to gain access to the secure information inside the computer. However, there is not enough power, and suggests heading to the power station.

### GamePlay
The environments in Blue Stinger are entirely 3D. Players heal themselves in real-time using food and drinks bought from vending machines, forcing players to heal only when it's safe. Combat consists of purchasing weapons and ammunition in the same manner, including swords, rocket launchers, napalm launchers and triple-barreled shotguns. Eliot starts out with a pistol while Dogs starts with a crossbow. Besides shooter game elements, the game also uses beat 'em up elements when weapons are not equipped.
